# kratos performance platform

## TODO Plan

1. Run test using simple js script as source from command line -- currently being developed
2. Start server and run test from js source (either s3 file or string from http req)
3. Create master that will sync all nodes, gather metrics at the end of test
4. Gather metrics at interval from tests
